[_Jodie into Terror_]({{ url }}) was our flashcast on the Jodie Whittaker era of _Doctor Who_ — the forerunner to [_The Second Great and Bountiful Human Empire_][2gab]. When we first heard that Jodie Whittaker would be the new Doctor, we realised that we couldn’t wait six or seven years to talk about her historic new era, and so we started to record our ill-judged off-the-cuff reactions to the new episodes just days after they aired.
