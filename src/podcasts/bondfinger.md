[_Bondfinger_]({{ url }}) was our James Bond commentary podcast, which also ended up covering shows like _The Avengers_, _The Prisoner_ and even _The Champions_. It’s our second love, a testament not just to the James Bond movie series and the wonderful sixties TV that influenced it, but also to many glorious evenings at Richard’s place, eating and drinking and laughing ourselves stupid. And it’s the spiritual forerunner of _Startling Barbara Bain_.
