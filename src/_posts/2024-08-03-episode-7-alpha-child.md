An eerie green glow is making for Alpha, bringing with it the most terrible consequences, as the first baby born on the base undergoes two periods of ultra-rapid growth, becoming in mere seconds a terrifying English moppet and shortly after that Julian Glover in a skimpy miniskirt. Is this the next stage in human evolution, or merely an invasion by an alien who wants to give his mother a nice makeover and a good rogering before (inevitably) killing everyone on the base?
